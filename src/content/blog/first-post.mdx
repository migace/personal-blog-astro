I will be honest with you - I'm not sure what I'm doing. It's the best. I don't know so good
English, I'm not sure that I know how to write a professional tech blog in this language.
So, what I know?

### Experience

I can share my over 10 years of experience in programming. I can teach you something because I saw
a lot of projects and I was working with a lot of people. I can and I want do it.

### Willingness

I love sharing my knowledge. You could hear me here:

- [React - perfomance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03DvePOx9RM&t=2217s)
- [Comarch - DevRing](https://www.comarch.pl/szkolenia/nagrania-z-devring/)

I [won](https://hackyeah.pl/2020/12/10/the-winner-dodowork/) the HackYeah with my super team.\
I want do it still.

### Challenges

I love challenges. I love improving my skills. Tech blog in a foreign language is the next step in my career.

Keep your fingers crossed. To the next article.
